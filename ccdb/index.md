### What is this data?

Each week we send thousands of consumers' complaints about financial products and services to companies for response. Complaints are listed in the database after the company responds or after they’ve had the complaint for 15 calendar days, whichever comes first. We publish the consumer’s description of what happened if the consumer opts to share it and after taking steps to remove personal information. See our [Scrubbing Standard](http://files.consumerfinance.gov/a/assets/201503_cfpb_Narrative-Scrubbing-Standard.pdf) and [Third Party Study](http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201509_cfpb_evaluation-of-narrative-scrubbing-standard-and-process.pdf) for more details.

We don’t verify all the facts alleged in these complaints, but we take steps to confirm a commercial relationship. We may remove complaints if they don’t meet all of the publication criteria as defined in our [policy statement](http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201303_cfpb_Final-Policy-Statement-Disclosure-of-Consumer-Complaint-Data.pdf). Data is refreshed nightly.

The Consumer Complaint Database contains complaints we've received about consumer financial products and services, including:

- Bank accounts or services
- Consumer loans
- Credit cards
- Credit reporting
- Debt collection
- Money transfers
- Mortgages
- Private student loans
- Payday loans
- Other consumer loan (such as pawn and title loans)
- Other financial service (such as credit repair and debt settlement)
