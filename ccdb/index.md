### What is this data?

Each week we send thousands of consumers' complaints about financial products and services to companies for response. Complaints are listed in the database after the company responds or after they’ve had the complaint for 15 calendar days, whichever comes first. We publish the consumer’s description of what happened if the consumer opts to share it and after taking steps to remove personal information. See our

The Consumer Complaint Database contains complaints we’ve received about consumer financial products and services. In April 2017 we updated the form consumers use to submit complaints. The changes include reorganizing how products, sub-products, issues, and sub-issues are grouped and making some plain language improvements.

The Consumer Complaint Database shows the consumer’s original product, sub-product, issue, and sub-issue selections consistent with the options available on the form at the time the consumer submitted the complaint.
