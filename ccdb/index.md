### What is this data?

Each week we send thousands of consumers' complaints about financial products and services to companies for response. Complaints are listed in the database after the company responds or after they’ve had the complaint for 15 calendar days, whichever comes first. We publish the consumer’s description of what happened if the consumer opts to share it and after taking steps to remove personal information. See our

We don’t verify all the facts alleged in these complaints, but we take steps to confirm a commercial relationship between the consumer and the company. We may remove complaints if they don’t meet all of the publication criteria as defined in our

The Consumer Complaint Database contains complaints we’ve received about consumer financial products and services. In Spring 2017, we made some changes to how we present the products and services in response to feedback from consumers and stakeholders. The changes included streamlining and reorganizing how things were grouped, as well as making some plain language improvements. As a result, you’ll see both old and new values in the Database, depending on whether the complaint was submitted before or after these changes.
