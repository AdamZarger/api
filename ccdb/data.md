This release reflects changes to the <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/">consumer complaint form</a>.
<ul>
  <li>The issues consumers can select on the student loan complaint form were revised. “Repaying your loan” and “Problems when you are unable to pay” were removed and “Can’t pay my loan” and “Dealing with my lender or servicer” were added.</li>
  <li>Consumers can now select a sub-issue for student loan complaints.</li>
  <li>Consumers can now submit a credit reporting complaint about the issues “Incorrect information on my credit report” and “Credit reporting company’s investigation” without first filing a dispute with the credit reporting company.</li>
</ul> 
Complaints we receive beginning December 18, 2013, will reflect these changes as they appear in the database. Complaints received before then will remain unchanged.
